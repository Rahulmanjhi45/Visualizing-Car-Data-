# ðŸš— Visualizing Car Data: A Comprehensive Guide ðŸ“Š

## Introduction
Visualizing Car Data is a project focused on creating various types of plots to visualize car-related data.
The project includes different plot types such as line plots, bar plots, scatter plots,
3D plots, and more, aiming to provide comprehensive insights through visual representation.


## Features
The project includes the following types of plots:

Line Plot  
Bar Plot  
3D Bar Plot  
Histogram  
Scatter Plot  
3D Scatter Plot  
Stack Plot  
Pie Chart  
Sub-plots  
Wireframe  
Heatmap  
Joint Plots  
Violin Plot  
Box Plot  
Bubble Plot  
Web Plot  
Tree Plot  
Venn Diagram  
Word Cloud  

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following software and libraries:

Python 3.x  
Matplotlib  
Seaborn  
Pandas  
NumPy  
Plotly (optional for 3D plots)  
Jupyter Notebook (recommended for interactive exploration)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:   
    [git clone https://github.com/yourusername/visualizing-car-data.git
](https://github.com/Rahulmanjhi45/Visualizing-Car-Data-.git)
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   cd visualizing-car-data

3. Install the required Python packages:  
   pip install -r requirements.txt

  
## Usage
To start visualizing the car data, follow these steps:

1. Open Jupyter Notebook:  
   jupyter notebook

2. Open the main project file:  
   Navigate to `visualizing_car_data.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface.

3. Run the notebook cells to generate various plots.

## How to Run
To run the visualizations, execute the cells in the Jupyter Notebook.
Each cell corresponds to a different plot type, and you can modify the data or parameters to suit your specific needs.
