## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following software and libraries:

Python 3.x  
Matplotlib  
Seaborn  
Pandas  
NumPy  
Plotly (optional for 3D plots)  
Jupyter Notebook (recommended for interactive exploration)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:   
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/visualizing-car-data.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   cd visualizing-car-data

3. Install the required Python packages:  
   pip install -r requirements.txt

  
## Usage
To start visualizing the car data, follow these steps:

1. Open Jupyter Notebook:  
   jupyter notebook

2. Open the main project file:  
   Navigate to `visualizing_car_data.ipynb` in the Jupyter interface.

3. Run the notebook cells to generate various plots.

## How to Run
To run the visualizations, execute the cells in the Jupyter Notebook.
Each cell corresponds to a different plot type, and you can modify the data or parameters to suit your specific needs.
